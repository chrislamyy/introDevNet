# Dive deeper. Explore the Documents, Downloads, Learnings, Videos for One of the APIs
There are hundreds of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) available from DevNet. APIs open new opportunities for coders to create network-aware applications, and network engineers to set policy for those applications in the network. To demonstrate the scope of learning tools that are available, this learning lab will show you one particular API, the APIC-EM controller's REST API. The APIC-EM is an SDN controller for policy-based automation of the network infrastructure, simplifying deployment and network operations. The APIC-EM exposes all of its capabilities through its REST API.

### Step 1: Visit [DevNet home page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/home/index.gsp).
Click **Technologies** in the top navigation. Using the left navigation in the pull down mega menu, select **Networking** from the left side mega menu. Then, find and click **APIC Enterprise Module (APIC-EM)**.

### Step 2: Click **Docs**
Welcome to the APIC Enterprise Module (APIC-EM) page. Click click **Docs** in the upper-right area.
